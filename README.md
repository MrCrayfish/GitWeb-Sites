# GitWeb-Sites
This is the repository containing the community of user created sites (referred from here on out as indexes) for the GitWeb client available with MrCrayfish's Device Mod.

**Note**: There is a web-based client created by [Pugduddly](https://github.com/Pugduddly), but it is under development and is not 100% accurate with the Device Mod client.
However, it could make it easier to develop your own indexes.
If you want to try it, it is available at https://gitweb-js.glitch.me/.
