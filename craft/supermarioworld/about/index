text=The &9Super Mario World Application's&r coding concept came from an old project of mine called the &6"Advanced Tech Mod"&r. This project made me think more about having a game inside of a GUI in &aMinecraft&r. The project may have been abandoned, but it sprouted a whole new way of thinking about &aMinecraft&r for me.

text=My name is & &eOcelot5836&r, and I have been programming for roughly four years now. I would consider myself an intermediate coder at &cJava&r since I know and understand the basics of the language. There are many above me who could probably think twenty different ways to do what I have done here, but that doesn't mean I can't do what I want to accomplish. I always try to keep on learning from people who are better at programming (like &4MrCrayfish&r) than I since that allows me to learn and grow as not only a programmer, but a person. I hope any person who has such a dream as to program can take the chance to become the very best programmer the world has ever seen.
