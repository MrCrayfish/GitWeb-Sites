text=Welcome to the &4Super Mario World Wiki!&r Here you can find information about almost every aspect of the game! Below are listed a few categories that the &ewiki&r is split up into. I hope you enjoyed the game so far and enjoy it even more after reading this.

#paragraph
text=&eEntities&r in the game are essentially objects ot anything that is not locked onto a grid. Unlike tiles, &eentities&r have the capability to move at whatever speed they need to and with as much precision possible. They are used for a variety of things such as utility or even things like the &6Player&r\n\nLink - &bsupermarioworld.craft/pages/wiki/entity

#paragraph
text=&eTiles&r are objects in the game that are set to a grid in the world. They can not move in very precise manors and usually interact with &6entities&r. &eTiles&r can be solid on all or just one or two of their sides depending on the &etile's&r design.\n\nLink - &bsupermarioworld.craft/pages/wiki/tile
