text=&4&lDescription:&r\nAir and Void tiles are specifically used to block and allow the player to pass when needed. The Air tile is used as a placeholder for any tile that doesn't exist and should not render. It can be passed through and not interacted with. The Void tile is the exact opposite since it can be collided with and is rendered as a black quad. You can not usually see this tile in game since it is usually the tiles that are offscreen and not defined.
